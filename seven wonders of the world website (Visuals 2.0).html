                                The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Egyptologists conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it was built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years.The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks weighing 6 million tonnes in total. The majority of stones are not uniform in size or shape and are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used. Other blocks were imported by boat down the Nile: White limestone from Tura for the casing, and granite blocks from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the King's Chamber structure.

                                        A conversation with Lisa Ackerman, World Monuments Fund, and Beth Harris, Smarthistory. Created by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker. According to ancient accounts, the Hanging Gardens were a terraced structure with a series of tiered gardens built one above the other. Each level was said to be supported by columns and arches, and the gardens were planted with a variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers. It was described as a lush and beautiful oasis in the heart of the city of Babylon. These gardens are often attributed to King Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the 6th century BCE. However, there is some debate among historians about their existence and the exact location of the gardens.

                                        The Colossus of Rhodes  was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, whose son Demetrius I of Macedon unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305 BC. According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high—the approximate height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown—making it the tallest statue of the ancient world. It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC; although parts of it were preserved, it was never rebuilt.
                                        As of 2015, there are tentative plans to build a new Colossus at Rhodes Harbour, although the actual location of the original remains in dispute.

                                                Construction: The lighthouse was built during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283-246 BCE), a ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. It was designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus and took several years to complete.
                                                Purpose: The primary purpose of the Lighthouse of Alexandria was to serve as a navigational aid for sailors entering the busy port of Alexandria, which was a major trading hub in the Mediterranean. It was also considered a symbol of the city's wealth and prestige.
                                                Architecture: The lighthouse was a remarkable feat of ancient engineering and stood approximately 100-130 meters (330-430 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest structures of the ancient world. It was built in three tiers: a square bottom with a central core, a middle octagonal section, and a circular top with a platform and a massive bronze statue of Zeus or Poseidon. At night, a fire was lit on the platform, and during the day, sunlight reflected off polished bronze plates to create a visible beacon.

                                                The Temple of Artemis or Artemision , also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis. It was located in Ephesus . It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed. Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.
                                                Location: The Temple of Artemis was located in the ancient city of Ephesus, which is in present-day Turkey. Ephesus was a major city in the ancient world and a center of worship for the goddess Artemis.

Construction: The construction of the temple is attributed to multiple architects and took place over several centuries. The most famous version of the temple was designed and built by the Greek architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes in the 6th century BCE. This temple was larger and more elaborate than its predecessors.

The temple, built in the second quarter of the fifth century BCE, was the very model of the fully developed classical Greek temple of the Doric order.
                                                        Construction: The construction of the Temple of Zeus began in the 5th century BCE, during the rule of the Elean architect Libon. It took several decades to complete the temple due to interruptions such as wars and political conflicts. The temple was eventually finished in the 4th century BCE.

Architecture: The Temple of Zeus at Olympia was a Doric-style temple, characterized by its simple, harmonious design. It was made of local limestone and marble and was one of the largest temples in Greece. The temple measured about 64 meters (210 feet) in length and 27 meters (89 feet) in width. It had 6 columns on the façade (the front) and 13 columns on each long side, for a total of 34 columns.

                                                        The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or Tomb of Mausolus  was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC at Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, a satrap in the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene. Its elevated tomb structure is derived from the tombs of neighbouring Lycia, a territory Mausolus had invaded and annexed circa 460 BC, such as the Nereid Monument.
                                                        Commission and Purpose: The Mausoleum was commissioned by Artemisia II of Caria, who was the queen and wife of Mausolus, the satrap (governor) of the region under the Persian Empire. The purpose of the Mausoleum was to serve as a grand tomb for Mausolus, who died around 353/352 BCE.

Architecture: The Mausoleum was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius. It was a remarkable example of ancient Greek architecture, blending various styles, including Ionic, Doric, and Egyptian influences.
